# Safe Trip

Git is separated into two different folders, one for app development, the other for server development.

## App

### Setup

Use https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup to setup env
only thing changed is nodejs version
There is a section that says 'Creating new application'. Do not do this as app is already created
Continue on section that says 'Running your React Native application'

Install chocolatey from https://chocolatey.org/install
Once installed run `choco install nodejs.install --version=15.2.1 openjdk8`

## Server
